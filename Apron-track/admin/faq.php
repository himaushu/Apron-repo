                          <p>No, you do not need to order tracking tags or a barcode scanner in order to use Apron Tracking System. You can create your own serial numbers and enter them by typing them in. However, using barcode is optional which optimizes Apron Tracking System by helping users search for aprons and retrieve apron information quicker and with 100% accuracy.</p>
